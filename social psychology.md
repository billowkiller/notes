People aren't neutral. Instead they come in with certain predispositions, certain tendencies that lead them to process social information in very particular way.


**Confirmation Bias**

*	A confirmation bias is a preference for information that's consistent with a preconception, rather than information that challenges it.

*	people tend to seek out evidence that confirms their expectations and they give greater weight to that evidence than evidence that would dis-confirm their exceptions.

**Self-fulfilling prophecy**

*	The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the originally false conception come true thereby perpetuating a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof of being right from the beginning. Such are the perversities of social logic.
