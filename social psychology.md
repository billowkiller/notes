**Hindsight Bias**

*	Hindsight bias, or the "I knew-it-all-along effect,", is the tendency to exaggerate, after learning an outcome, one's ability to have foreseen the outcome.
*	Moral of the story: Findings are harder to predict when you don;t already know the outcome!

People aren't neutral. Instead they come in with certain predispositions, certain tendencies that lead them to process social information in very particular way.


**Confirmation Bias**

*	A confirmation bias is a preference for information that's consistent with a preconception, rather than information that challenges it.

*	people tend to seek out evidence that confirms their expectations and they give greater weight to that evidence than evidence that would dis-confirm their exceptions.

**Self-fulfilling prophecy**

*	The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the originally false conception come true thereby perpetuating a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof of being right from the beginning. Such are the perversities of social logic.

*	Behavioral confirmation takes place when people's social expectations lead them to act in a way that causes others to confirm these expectations. Social type of self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Why Are Thin-Slice Judgements Accurate?**

* May have evolutionary value, such as rapidly identifying:
    
    * Potential threats
    * Possible partners
    * Competent leaders

* Our brains may process emotions before cognitions

* Thin Slices may avoid idstractions that lower accruacy

**Some Strengths and Weaknesses**

* Social Judgements can take place very rapidly, sometimes with surprising accuracy.

* At the same time, they're prone to certain biases and distortions, and once our Judgements are formed, we tend to lock into them and search for confirming evidence rather than chanllenging the judgments we've already made.

**Salience and Causal Attribution**

* In general, the more salient a stimulus is, the more likely it is to be viewed as causal.

* Perceptions of causality are partly a function of where one's attention is directed.

* And attention is in turn a function of salience.

If we want to make fair and accurate judgments about what led somebody to behave in a certain way, or who's responsible or, in the case of a crime, even who's guity, then we probably don't want to be influenced by where we happen to be influenced by where we happen to be looking at the moment that we're making the judgment, and we sure don't want to be influenced without knowing it.

**Atitude and behavior**

Atitude and behavior inconsistency. Often

* Maybe journals reject reports of consistency.

* Many attitudes relate to any one behavior.

* Many behaviors relate to any one attitude.

* Attitude items tend to be more general.

* Attitudes and behaviors are often elicited under different conditions.

Attitudes and behaviors are most likely to be related when:

* They closely match each other(e.g., in generality/specificity)

* The attitude is strong or potent(e.g., acquired through experience)

* The attitude is easy to recall and has been stable overtime

* People are made aware of themselves and their attitudes.

* Outside influences are kept to a minimum

People generally motivated to reduce or avoid psychological inconsistencies


You don't have enough respect for your own thinking, for your own ideas, to follow them through to their logical conclusion, and you expect me to do that? This is graduate school, this isn't kindergarten.

**How to Be Persuasive**

Some Effective Social Influence Techniques

* Asking people to imagine or predict doing something
* Telling a stranger your name before making a request
* Engaging people in dialogue rather than a monologue(talking *with* people rather than *at* people)

Three famous techniques:

* The Foot-in-the-Door Technique
	* Premise: People are more likely to comply with a large request after a small one
	* consistent with self-perception theory
* The Door-in-the-Face Technique
	* When people reject a large request, they often become more likely to comply with **smaller** request down the road

* The Low-Ball Technique
	* This social influence technique involves only one request (e.g., to participate in an experiment on thinking processes), but the cost of complying is increased after people say yes.
